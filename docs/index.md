<h1>PRSice-2: Polygenic Risk Score software</h1>

PRSice (pronounced 'precise') is a Polygenic Risk Score software for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of polygenic risk scores (PRS) analyses. Some of the features include:

1. High-resolution scoring (PRS calculated across a large number of P-value thresholds)
2. Identify Most predictive PRS
3. Empirical P-values output (not subject to over-fitting)
4. Genotyped (PLINK binary) and imputed (Oxford bgen v1.2) data input
5. Biobank-scale genotyped data can be analysed within hours
6. Incorporation of covariates
7. Application across multiple target traits simultaneously
8. Results plotted in several formats (bar plots, high-res plots, quantile plots)
9. PRSet: function for calculating PRS across user-defined pathways / gene sets

!!! Caution 

    PRSet are currently under open beta - results output are reliable but please report any specific problems to our google group (see Support below)

# R Packages Requirements

To plot graphs, PRSice requires [R](https://www.r-project.org/) (**version 3.2.3+**) installed.

[Additional steps](extra_steps.md) might be required for Mac and Windows users.

!!! Note "Installing required R packages" 

    PRSice can automatically download all required packages, even without administrative right.
    You can specify the install directory using `--dir`. For example

    ```
        Rscript PRSice.R --dir .
    ```

    will install all required packages under the local directory.

# Quick Start
For Quick start use, please refer to [Quick Start](quick_start.md)

!!! tip "List user options"

    You can also type

    ```
        ./PRSice
    ```

    to view all available parameters unrelated to plotting, or

    ```
        Rscript PRSice.R -h
    ```

    to view all available parameters, including those used for plotting
