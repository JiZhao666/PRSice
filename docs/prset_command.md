# Introduction

!!! important

    It is vital that the human genome build is the same for the GTF file,
    bed files, target file and the base file.
    Otherwise the coordinates of the SNPs can be wrong and PRSice will
    not be able to correctly assign the gene membership, leading to
    invalid results.

# Command
- `--bed` | `-B`

    Bed file containing the selected regions.
    Name of bed file will be used as the region
    identifier. WARNING: Bed file is 0-based

- `--feature`

    Feature(s) to be included from the gtf file.

    Default: *exon,CDS,gene,protein_coding*

- `--gtf` | `-g`

    GTF file containing gene boundaries. Required when `--msigdb` is used

    !!! tip

        Human Genome build GRCh38 can be downloaded from [here](ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-86/gtf/homo_sapiens).

- `--msigdb` | `-m`

    MSigDB file containing the pathway information. Require the gtf file.
    The GMT file format used by MSigDB is a simple tab/space delimited text file
    where each line correspond to a single gene set following by Gene IDs:
    ```
        [Set A] [Gene 1] [Gene 2] ...
        [Set B] [Gene 1] [Gene 2] ...
    ```

    !!! tip

        Curated MSigDB files can be downloaded from [here](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/) after registration in [here](http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/login.jsp;jsessionid=EEFB5FCE8B9B285B2F789B46B388A647#msigdb)

- `--set-perm`               

    The number of set base permutation to perform. 
    This is only used for calculating the competitive p-value. 
    10,000 generally will be enough. 

- `--snp-set`               

    Provide a SNP set file containing a single snp set.
    Name of SNP set file will be used as the region
    identifier. This file should contain only one column.
    
- `--snp-sets`

    Provide a SNP set file containing multiple snp sets.
    Each row represent a single SNP set with the first
    column containing name of the SNP set.
