Currently only SNP major PLINK format are supported  (default output of the latest PLINK program).\n\n\nThe \n.bed\n and \n.bim\n file must have the same prefix.\n\n\nIf the \n.fam\n file follow a different prefix from the \n.bed\n and \nbim\n file, it can be specified using\n\n\n--target \nbim bed prefix\n,\nfam file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nThe fam file MUST contains the correct number of samples or PRSice will crash\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n-9 will \nNOT\n be considered as missing for quantitative traits\n\n\n\n\nIf the binary file is separated into individual chromosomes, then an # can be used to specify the location of the chromosome number in the file name.\nPRSice will automatically substitute # with 1-22\n\n\ni.e. If the files are chr1.\n,chr2.\n,...,chr22.\n, just use\n\n\n--target chr#\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nChromosome number substitution will not be performed on the external fam file as the fam file should be the same for all chromosomes. \n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, if your PLINK files do not have a unified prefix, you can use \n--target-list\n to provide a file containing all\nprefix to PRSice. \n\n\nBGEN\n\n\nPRSice currently support BGEN v1.1 and v1.2. To specify a BGEN file, simply add the \n--type bgen\n or \n--ld-type bgen\n to the PRSice command\n\n\nAs BGEN does not store the phenotype information and sometime not even the sample ID, you \nmust\n provide\na phenotype file (\n--pheno-file\n) for PRSice to run. Alternatively, the sample file can be provided using\n\n\n--target \nbgen prefix\n,\nsample file\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nThe sample file is required even if \n--no-regress\n is set as the sample ID is required for output. This requirement might be losen in future versions\n\n\n\n\nWith BGEN input, a number of PRSice options become effective:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--hard\n: Normally, with BGEN format, PRS is calculated using the dosage information.\nBut hard-thresholding can be performed by using the \n--hard\n option. SNPs will then coded as the genotype (0,1 or 2) with\nprobability larger than threshold specified by \n--hard-thres\n. If no such genotype is presented, the SNP will be\ncoded as missing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--hard-thres\n: The genotype probability threshold.

A GTF file contains the genome boundary of the genetic\nelements within the human genome and PRSet can use the information from GTF to determine if\na SNP falls within a specific gene.\nOne can download the GTF file file Human (Genome build GTCh38.p7) \nhere\n.\n\n\nPRSet will look for any regions with feature  of \nexon\n, \ngene\n, \nprotein_coding\n or \nCDS\n (\ncase sensitive\n).\nAny genomic regions without these features will be ignored.\nAlternatively, you can specify the features using the \n--feature\n command.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nFor those who are unfamiliar, different version of the genome might differ slightly in their coordinates. Therefore it is vital to ensure all the files are originated from the same genome build\n\n\n\n\nBed Files\n\n\nIn addition, PRSet also accept bed file(s) as an input.\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\nA bed file \nmust\n contain a minimum of 3 columns:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nchrom\n - The name of the chromosome (e.g. chr3, chrY, chr2_random) or scaffold (e.g. scaffold10671).\n\n\nchromStart\n - The starting position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The first base in a chromosome is numbered 0.\n\n\nchromEnd\n - The ending position of the feature in the chromosome or scaffold. The chromEnd base is not included in the display of the feature. For example, the first 100 bases of a chromosome are defined as chromStart=0, chromEnd=100, and span the bases numbered 0-99.\n\n\n\n\nPRSet will read in any number of bed files (comma separated) and use the file names as the name of the gene set.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nAn annoying feature of bed file is that it starts with 0 whereas for example, the plink formats starts the coordinates at 1. So do remember to -1 from the region start when you build your own bed file from scratch.\n\n\n\n\nP-value Threshold and Proxy Clumping\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nProxy PRSet\n\n\nOne complication in PRSet is the definition of SNP membership.\nThe default option of PRSet is to only include SNPs that are physically within the target region.\nHowever, it is also likely for SNPs outside the region to influence functions of the set.\nTherefore we provide the \n--proxy\n option. Essentially, this provide a soft cutoff to SNP membership.\nFor example, when user define \n--proxy 0.8\n, if LD between SNP A and SNP B is more than 0.8, then SNP A will be considered to be within the same regions as SNP B and vice versa.\n\n\nP-value thresholding\n\n\nBy default, PRSet do not perform p-value thresholding and will simply calculate the set based PRS at P-value threshold of 1. \nThis is because it is unclear whether the set is associated with the phenotype when the best-threshold contained only a small portion of SNPs within the gene sets.\nIf you wish to perform p-value thresholding with PRSet, you will need to specify any of the parameters related to p-value thresholding, i.e. \n--interval\n, \n--lower\n, \n--upper\n, \n--fastscore\n or \n--bar-levels\n.\n\n\nSet Based Association\n\n\nA challenge in Set base analysis is to obtain a competitive p-value, which indicates the level of enrichment, as opposed to the self-contained p-value which indicates the level of association. \nTo obtain a competitive p-value, PRSet can perform a permutation analysis. \nBriefly, for a set containing \n\\(N\\)\n SNPs, PRSet will construct a null set by randomly selecting \n\\(N\\)\n SNPs from the background (default is the genic region). \nA null p-value is then obtained by performing an association between the PRS of the null set with the phenotype. You can specify the number of permutation by \n--set-perm\n\n\nOutput Data\n\n\nPRS model-fit\n\n\nA file containing the PRS model fit across thresholds is named \n[Name].prsice\n, where \n[Name]\n is the\noutput prefix name as specified by \n--out\n this is stored as\n\n\nName of Set, Threshold, R2, P-value, Coefficient, Standard Error, and Number of SNPs at this threshold\n\n\nScores for each individual\n\n\nA file containing PRS for each individual at the best-fit PRS named\n\n\n[Name].best\n is provide.\nThis file has the format of:\n\n\nFID,IID, In Regression, PRS at best threshold for Set 1, PRS at best threshold for Set 2, ...\n\n\nWhere the has phenotype column indicate whether the sample contain all\nthe required phenotype for PRSice analysis (e.g. Samples with missing\nphenotype/covariate will not be included in the regression.\nThese samples will be indicated as \"No\" under the in regression column)\n\n\nIf \n--all\n option is used, a file named\n\n\n[Name].all.score\n is also generated\n\n\nPlease note, if \n--all\n options is used, the PRS for each individual at all threshold will be given.\nIn the event where the target sample size is large and a lot of threshold are tested, this file can be large.\nThis is especially true when large number of gene sets were provided.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\nPRSice also supports multiple phenotypes for target data.\nAll output prefix will change to [Name].[Pheno] where [Pheno]\nis the name of the phenotype. \nFor more details on the options used to implement this, see\n\nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nSummary Information\n\n\nInformation of the best model fit of each phenotype and gene set is stored in [Name].summary.\nThe summary file contain the following fields:\n\n\n\n\nPhenotype\n - Name of Phenotype\n\n\nSet\n - Name of Gene Set\n\n\nThreshold\n - Best P-value Threshold\n\n\nPRS.R2\n - Variance explained by the PRS.

PRS will be reset\nto 0 for each new P-value threshold instead ofadding up    --out  |  -o  Prefix for all file output.   Note  If multiple target phenotypes are included (e.g. using  --pheno-col ),\nthe phenotype will be appended to the output prefix  If multiple gene set are included, the name of the set will be appended\nto the output prefix (after the phenotype (if any))     --perm  Number of permutation to perform. This will\ngenerate the empirical p-value. Recommend to\nuse value larger than or equal to 10,000   Note  When permutation is required, PRSice will perform the following\noperation   Perform normal PRSice across all thresholds and obtain p-value of the\nmost significant threshold  Repeat PRSice analysis  N  times with permuted phenotype. Count the\nnumber of time where the p-value of the most significant threshold for\nthe permuted      --print-snp  Print all SNPs used to construct the best PRS    --seed  |  -s  Seed used for permutation. If not provided,\nsystem time will be used as seed. This will\nallow the same results to be generated when\nthe same seed and input is used    --thread  |  -n  Number of thread use   Tip  Maximum number of thread can be specified by using  --thread max    Note  PRSice will limit the maximum number of thread used to the number of core available on the system as detected by PRSice.     --x-range               \n    Range of SNPs to be excluded from the whole\n    analysis. It can either be a single bed file\n    or a comma seperated list of range. Range must\n    be in the format of  chr:start-end  or  chr:coordinate    --help  |  -h  Display the help messages",
