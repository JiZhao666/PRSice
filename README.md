# PRSice [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/choishingwan/PRSice.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/choishingwan/PRSice)
PRSice (pronounced 'precise') is a software package for calculating, applying, evaluating and plotting the results of polygenic risk scores (PRS). 
PRSice can run at high-resolution to provide the best-fit PRS as well as provide results calculated at broad P-value thresholds, illustrating results corresponding to either, can thin SNPs according to linkage disequilibrium and P-value ("clumping"), and can be applied across multiple traits in a single run.

Based on a permutation study we estimate a significance threshold of P = 0.001 for high-resolution PRS analyses - the work on this is included in our Bioinformatics paper on PRSice.

PRSice is a software package written in R and C++. PRSice runs as a command-line program with a variety of user-options and is freely available for download below, compatible for Unix/Linux/Mac OS.
